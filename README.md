Insurance Analysis Project

## Overview

This project performs an analysis on insurance data using a Jupyter Notebook. The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, and various statistical analyses to understand the trends and patterns in the insurance dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `insurance.csv`, which contains information about individuals, including their age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoker status, region, and insurance charges.

## Project Structure

- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and data visualization.
- `insurance.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `Insurance.pbix`: Power BI for visualization.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Setup

To run this project, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the necessary packages using `pip`.

```sh
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

## Analysis Summary
In this project, we explore the insurance dataset to answer the following questions:

What is the distribution of insurance charges?
How do charges vary with age, BMI, and smoking status?
Are there any noticeable patterns based on the region?
The analysis includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
Statistical analysis to identify significant factors affecting insurance charges
Results
Distribution of Insurance Charges
Insurance charges range from a few hundred dollars to over $60,000.
The distribution is right-skewed, with a majority of charges concentrated in the lower range.
Charges Variation with Age
There is a positive correlation between age and insurance charges.
Older individuals tend to have higher insurance charges.
Charges Variation with BMI
BMI is positively correlated with insurance charges.
Higher BMI values are
